# Task 1

## Prediction using Supervised ML
#### (Level Beginner)

- Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours 
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

<b>Linear regression</b> is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.

### Positive Linear Relationship:

If the dependent variable increases on the Y-axis and independent variable increases on X-axis, then such a relationship is termed as a Positive linear relationship.

### Negative Linear Relationship:

If the dependent variable decreases on the Y-axis and independent variable increases on the X-axis, then such a relationship is called a negative linear relationship.
